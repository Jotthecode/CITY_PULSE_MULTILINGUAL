1. Project Title
City Pulse: Multilingual Voice Agent MVP
 2. Objective
To develop a minimal viable product (MVP) of a multilingual voice agent that allows users to speak in any supported language and receive spoken responses powered by OpenAI and Google Cloud APIs.
The goal is to enable a natural voice-based interaction that is language-agnostic, simple to use, and easily extendable.

3. Technologies Used
Layer
Technology
Backend Server
FastAPI (Python)
Voice Recognition
Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
Voice Synthesis
Google Cloud Text-to-Speech
Language AI
OpenAI GPT (text generation)
Frontend
HTML, JavaScript (Voice Recorder)
Storage / Secrets
.env, Git Ignore, Push Protection
Hosting (local)
Uvicorn development server

 4. Functional Workflow
User presses a button on the web interface to record speech.


The browser captures audio and sends it to the backend (/chat-voice).


Backend converts audio to text using Google Speech-to-Text.


The resulting text is passed to OpenAI for natural language generation.


OpenAI's reply is converted back into speech using Google Text-to-Speech.


The audio response is returned and played in the browser.

7. Security & GitHub Push Fixes
Issue: GitHub rejected a push due to service_account_key.json being committed.


Fix:


Secrets removed from Git history.


.gitignore updated to include .env and service_account_key.json.


GitHub push protection now passes.
